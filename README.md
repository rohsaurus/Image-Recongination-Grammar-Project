**Hackathon repo for Gaze.**


Inspiration:

We were driven by the desire to create a tool that empowers individuals to ensure their written work is polished and error-free. Gaze tackles this challenge by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence.

What it Does:

Error Detection and Correction: Our program takes your paper as input, analyzes the text using cloud-based AI, and meticulously identifies and corrects grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and other inconsistencies.

How We Built It:

The foundation of Gaze lies in the integration of a robust cloud-based AI trained on vast amounts of textual data. This allows for comprehensive error detection and the ability to generate concise summaries tailored to your specific needs.

Challenges Faced:

Our journey wasn't without hurdles. Initial training resulted in an AI model corruption, requiring us to adapt and implement improved training methods.

Accomplishments:

We're proud to have developed a program that continuously learns and improves with each use. Gaze offers a valuable service, empowering users to create polished and impactful written content.

What We Learned:

This project provided valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI in language processing. We gained a deeper understanding of how AI can be harnessed to enhance written communication effectively.

What's Next:

We're constantly innovating to expand Gaze's functionalities. Our future vision includes integrating advanced summarization techniques and exploring the potential for language style customization.

We invite you to try Gaze and experience the power of AI-powered writing assistance!
